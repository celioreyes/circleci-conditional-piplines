# CircleCI Conditional Workflows

After reading through this [article](https://medium.com/labs42/monorepo-with-circleci-conditional-workflows-69e65d3f1bd0), decided to give this a try for an Apollo Federation set up. Using the [apollo-federation-demo](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-demo) services as the source, but with `yarn workspaces` instead of `lerna`.
